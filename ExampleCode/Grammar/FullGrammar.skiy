//Logical operators
-a          //negates the value of a  -6 -> 6, "-6" causes an error (at the present)

a & b       //a and b
a | b       //a or b
a ^ b       //a xor b
a and b     //a and b
a or b      //a or b
a xor b     //a xor b
a ? b : c   //if a then b else c              <-ternary operator
a ?: b      //if a is true, then a, else b    <-elvis operator, equivalent to a ? a : b, but does not evaluate 'a' twice
a ?? b      //if a null, then b, else a       <-null coalescence operator, equivalent to a!=null ? a : b, but does not evaluate 'a' twice

//Variables and assignment
var a       //initialise as 0
a = 5       //reassign a as 5. a must already exist

//control flow
//if statements
if (condition):

  action-if-true

  action-if-True

ie:

//for loop
for (increment variable) ("where" | "when") (condition) "do" (increment operation):

for (increment variable) "in" array-like:

ie:
for x (Where | When) x<=10:
  print(x)
//the loop increments by one implicitly

for x (Where | When) x<10 do x=x+2
  print(x)
//explicitly defining the increment operation

for x in 10:
  print(x)
//implicitly define '(Where | When) x<10' as 'in 10'        <-- NOT SURE IF I WANT TO KEEP THIS BEHAVIOUR

for x do x=x+2:
  print(x)
//basically a while loop with a defined increment and implicitly declared variable

for x in Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5):
  print(x)
//loops through the array-like, technically an implicit conditional and incremental
